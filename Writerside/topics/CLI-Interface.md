# CLI Interface

This is the legacy interface and is a Command Line interface that you run from a terminal.

First you need to build a configuration file `default.yaml`, that's placed in `${HOME}/.hms-mirror/cfg`.
When you follow the above location and name, this configuration is loaded by default upon application
start.

To control the run behavior of the CLI, you can add many commandline parameters.  The application output
is describe [here](hms-mirror-output.md).

The CLI and Web versions use the same engine and share the same output/results.  Although, the
web interface has an online viewer for the results.  With the CLI version, you need to collect
the output, possibly bring it to you localhost and view it through a 'markdown' viewer.
